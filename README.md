# HB-SubTracker
HB MilestoneMonitor is a Discord bot that continuously tracks subscriber counts for any YouTube channel you configure, automatically detects customizable milestones (e.g. every 1 000 subs), and posts richly formatted alerts—including time elapsed, daily averages, before/after counts, subs‑per‑hour, pace comparison arrows, and the exact UTC hit time—directly into your server.
